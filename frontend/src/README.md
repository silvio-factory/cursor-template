# Frontend Source Directory (frontend/src/)

This directory contains the core application source code for the Next.js frontend:

- `app/`: Next.js 13+ App Router directory containing page components and routing logic
- Components are organized by feature/domain
- Shared utilities, hooks, and types are stored in their respective directories
- API integration layer and state management live here

## Structure

- `app/` - Contains the Next.js app router pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable React components used throughout the app
- `lib/` - Utility functions and shared logic
- `styles/` - CSS and styling files
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions and interfaces

This directory follows a modular structure to keep the code organized and maintainable. All new features and components should be added in their appropriate subdirectories following the established patterns.
