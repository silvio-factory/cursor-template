# AI Directory

This directory contains all AI/ML related code and integrations for the application.

## Purpose

- Implement AI model integrations (OpenAI, Hugging Face)
- Handle AI-related business logic
- Manage model inference and predictions
- Implement custom ML models
- Handle AI service configuration
- Manage AI-related caching and optimization

## Structure

- OpenAI API integration
- Hugging Face model implementations
- Custom ML model implementations
- Model configuration and settings
- AI service utilities and helpers
- Caching and optimization logic
- Model training scripts (if applicable)

## Best Practices

- Implement proper error handling for AI services
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Handle rate limiting and quotas
- Implement fallback mechanisms
- Monitor model performance and costs
- Validate AI responses
- Handle timeouts and retries
- Keep API keys and secrets secure
- Document model behaviors and limitations
