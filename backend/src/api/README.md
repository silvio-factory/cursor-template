# API Directory

This directory contains all the API routes and endpoint handlers for the FastAPI backend.

## Purpose

- Define API endpoints and their corresponding handlers
- Handle HTTP requests and responses
- Implement input validation and request parsing
- Manage API versioning and documentation
- Handle authentication and authorization middleware

## Structure

- Route handlers are organized by feature/domain
- Each module should focus on a specific resource or feature
- Endpoints follow RESTful conventions where applicable
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is automatically generated from the route definitions

## Best Practices

- Keep route handlers thin, delegating business logic to the services layer
- Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Document API endpoints using FastAPI's built-in documentation features
- Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization
