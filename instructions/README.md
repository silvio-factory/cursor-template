# Fundamental Principles

- Write clean, simple, readable code.
- Implement features in the simplest possible way.
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines).
- Test after every meaningful change.
- Focus on core functionality before optimization.
- Use clear, consistent naming.
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean, and modular code.
- Use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.
- AVOID huge refactoring and PREFERABLY break down the change in multiple steps.
- ALWAYS include the location and a little explanation of ALL new files you create as a comment.

# Error Fixing

- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English.
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible.
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information.

#Building Process

- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it.
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- When you are not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search or to check the documentation.

# Comments

- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code.
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong/obsolete.
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in the code. ALWAYS write well documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE.
- When writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write sentences.
